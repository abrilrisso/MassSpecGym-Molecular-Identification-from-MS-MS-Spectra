mplemented a Transformer-based system for spectral-to-chemical mapping. I developed a dual-objective Retrieval model using InfoNCE and Focal Loss and a De Novo decoder for SMILES generation. The project highlights advanced expertise in contrastive learning, chemical embeddings, and deep generative architectures.
